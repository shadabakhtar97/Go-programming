# Error Handling in Go Programming
### What is an Error in go programming ?

In Go programming, an error is a value that represents an abnormal or unexpected condition that has occurred during the execution of a program. Errors are used to signal and handle exceptional situations, such as file not found, network connection issues, division by zero, or any other circumstance that can prevent a program from executing as intended.

In Go, errors are typically represented by values of the built-in `error` interface type. The `error` interface is defined as follows:

```go
type error interface {
    Error() string
}
```

Any type that implements this interface by providing an `Error` method can be used as an error value in Go. The `Error` method should return a string that describes the error.

Here's a simple example of how errors are used in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "errors"
)

func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    result, err := divide(10, 2)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }

    result, err = divide(10, 0)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `divide` function returns an error if the second argument is zero, indicating a division by zero error. The `main` function checks for errors returned by `divide` and handles them accordingly.

Go encourages explicit error handling to ensure robust and reliable code. Developers are expected to check for errors and decide how to handle them, whether that involves logging the error, retrying an operation, or taking some other appropriate action.
